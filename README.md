# Road Lane Detection System

## Overview

The Road Lane Detection System using U-net Architecture is a project developed in Python, particularly utilizing Jupyter Notebook for code execution and experimentation. The system aims to detect road lanes from images using the U-net architecture, a convolutional neural network (CNN) commonly used for image segmentation tasks. The project utilizes a dataset from TuSimple, which contains images with annotated lane markings. The system's objective is to accurately identify road lanes, which is essential for various applications such as autonomous driving and lane departure warning systems.

## Features
